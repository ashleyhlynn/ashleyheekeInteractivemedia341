  <p>It can frustrating when someone in your life turns up their nose at half the items on their dinner plate. Picky eating is a problem that affects both children and adults, and can also have a negative effect on the people who eat with them or prepare their food. Children often need a bit of help to try new foods, so make eating fun and involve them in choosing ingredients. If you're trying to help an adult picky eater, encourage them to try new foods in different ways and provide non-judgmental support. In some cases, picky eating can be caused by an eating disorder called Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) that needs to be diagnosed and treated.</p>

   <p><strong>1. Don't force children to eat when they're full.</strong>While getting kids to join the clean plate club might seem like a good idea, it can actually cause them to develop picky eating habits. Since being overfull can cause stomach pain or other gastrointestinal problems, children who've been encouraged to eat more than they need may slowly begin to dislike eating.</p>

       <li>The foods that children will want to stop eating first are likely the most important ones -- like vegetables!</li>

    <p><strong>2. Introduce new foods gradually.</strong>New tastes, textures, and smells can be a little scary for children. Put very small portions of unfamiliar items on their plates, and don't make a big deal about the new arrival. You can also incorporate new foods into dishes that include items you know your kids like.</p>

      <li>For example, maybe your child has never had spinach. If you know they love creamy foods, try starting off with creamed spinach rather than a spinach salad. You can also try broccoli and cheese if they like cheesy flavors.</li>
    </ul>
