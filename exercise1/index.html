<h1>How to Deal with Picky Eaters</h1>
<h4>Co-Authored by <strong>Kylee Money</strong></h4>
<body>
  <p>It can be frustrating when someone in your life turns up 
    their nose at half the items on their dinner plate. 
    Picky eating is a problem that affects both children and adults, 
    and can also have a negative effect on the people who eat with them 
    or prepare their food. Children often need a bit of help to try new 
    foods, so make eating fun and involve them in choosing ingredients. 
    If you're trying to help an adult picky eater, encourage them to try 
    new foods in different ways and provide non-judgmental support. In some 
    cases, picky eating can be caused by an eating disorder called 
    Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) that needs to be 
    diagnosed and treated.

    <h3>Method 1: Helping Children to Like Healthy Foods</h3>

     <strong>
       1. Don't force children to eat when they're full.
      </strong><br>
    While getting kids to join the clean plate club might seem like a good idea, 
    it can actually cause them to develop picky eating habits. Since being overfull 
    can cause stomach pain or other gastrointestinal problems, children who've been 
    encouraged to eat more than they need may slowly begin to dislike eating.
  </p>
    <ul>
       <li>The foods that children will want to stop eating first are 
         likely the most important ones -- like vegetables!</li>
    </ul><br>

      2. Introduce new foods gradually.
      </strong><br>
      New tastes, textures, 
      and smells can be a little scary for children. Put very small portions of 
      unfamiliar items on their plates, and don't make a big deal about the new arrival. 
      You can also incorporate new foods into dishes that include items you know your 
      kids like.
    </p>
  </div>
    <ul>
      <li>For example, maybe your child has never had spinach. If 
        you know they love creamy foods, try starting off with creamed 
        spinach rather than a spinach salad. You can also try broccoli and 
        cheese if they like cheesy flavors.</li>
    </ul><br>

        3. Fill Children's Plates with Colors and Fun Shapes
      </strong><br>
      Make your meals into a game! Rather than encouraging children to 
      eat their carrots, tell them they need to eat the orange food to 
      complete the rainbow. You can also use cookie cutters to transform 
      unappealing items into circles, stars, or squares. Tell your child they 
      need to collect each shape.

      <strong>
        4. Avoid Making Separate Meals for Children
      </strong><br>
      Once your child realizes this is an option, it'll be very 
      difficult to take it back. Persevere through the food battles 
      and remind yourself that you're avoiding making more work for 
      yourself over the long term.
    </p>
    </div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Unless they have a clinical disorder like ARFID, children will
           eventually eat when they're hungry.
        </li>
      </ul><br>

              <strong>
                5. Involve Kids in Shopping and Meal Prep
              </strong><br>
              This will help children to feel invested in what they eat. 
              Especially when you're in the produce or meat sections, ask 
              them to pick out a few ingredients that they'd like to try. 
              Then, get them to help you pick out a recipe and prepare the 
              meal. Later, if they say don't like something, remind them that
              they chose it. This may be enough to get them to eat at least 
              a few bites.

                  6. Let Dessert be Dessert, Not A Reward
                </strong><br>
                Bribing your children to eat just 2 more bites of peas in 
                return for a bowl of ice cream isn't a good idea. This can make
                 them feel like sweets are the best foods, which they probably 
                 don't need more prompting to believe! It might also cause them 
                 to expect dessert after every meal. Instead, make 1 or 2 nights 
                 a week â€œdessert nights.
